# Stone Paper Scissor Game

A simple Stone Paper Scissor game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the GUI.

## Description

This project is a basic implementation of the classic Stone Paper Scissor game. The game is played between the user (Master Player) and the computer (Super Computer). The user selects one of the three options (Stone, Paper, or Scissor) by clicking on the respective button, and the computer randomly selects an option as well. The game then determines the winner based on the traditional rules of Stone Paper Scissor.
